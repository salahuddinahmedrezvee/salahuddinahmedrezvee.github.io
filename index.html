<p>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Engineering Science and Mechanics at Penn State University, working on materials development, device fabrication, and advanced characterization for biomedical applications. My research focuses on designing conductive polymer and liquid-metal composite systems, fabricating soft and microstructured electronic devices, and validating their mechanical, electrical, and interfacial performance for human-integrated applications.

My work spans printable electronics, lithography-based microfabrication, and bioadhesive interface engineering. I develop material systems, translate them into functional devices, and systematically characterize their structure–property relationships using microscopy, spectroscopy, thermal analysis, rheology, and electrical testing. These efforts support the development of scalable, reliable bioelectronic platforms for neural and wearable biomedical systems.
